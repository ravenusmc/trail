# The Trail 
## Intro

This is a project where I will try to build a text based version of the Oregon Trail computer game. I am not sure how it will turn out. I also believe that it may never be finished just because I may get bored and move onto a smaller project. I do not intend for this to happen since I do think it will be a fun thing to do. I also have to say that I do not have permission to make a copy of the game I am just making it to see if I can! Well, over the last few weeks I have added a lot more to the game and it essentially works now! It still has quite a few bugs and still need to work through a lot of minor issues however, one could technically play the game from start to finish now. 

# Getting started
